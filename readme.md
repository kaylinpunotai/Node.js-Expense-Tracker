Node.js Expense Tracker
A project for backend practice with Node.js, Express, PostGreSQL, and Sequelize

This app is designed to track a user's expenses and display data insights about spending.

I used Express as the Node.js framework, PostGreSQL (hosted on ElephantSQL) as the database, Sequelize to translate JavaScript to SQL, Pug for views, and Mocha for testing.

I wanted to focus on developing the backend, so the frontend does not look pretty.
